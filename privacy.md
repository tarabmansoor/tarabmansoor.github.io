# Unlaunch Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: May 10, 2020_

Unlauch ("we", "our", "us") respects your right to privacy and takes data privacy very seriously. This privacy policy explains who we are, how we collect, share and use Personal Information, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. This privacy policy applies to personal information that we collect through our website (unlaunch.io, www.unlaunch.io), our blog (blog.unlaunch.io) and when you use or interact with our services. 

This policy does not apply to the information Unlaunch receives from the third-party websites, mobile apps and other digital products that use the Unlaunch services. When our customers use the Unlaunch on their own websites and products, they remain responsible for their own privacy and security practices, which may differ from ours. You should consult the relevant privacy policies on our customers' websites and products to find out more about their privacy practices and your related choices

If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

## What Does Unlaunch Do?

Unlaunch is a feature release and experimentation platform built for engineering teams, product teams in small startups to large enterprises. We provide a complete solution to enable teams to release their features into production quickly and safely. We also allow teams to be data-driven and make informed decisions on their feature releases based on actual data.

## Data That We Collect

The Personal Information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Unlaunch, your Unlaunch account settings, the products and features you use, your location, and applicable law. However, the Personal Information we collect broadly falls into the following categories:

### Account, Profile and Contact Information. 

Certain parts of our Website may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

In some cases another user (such as an administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including personal information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products). We collect Information under the direction of our customers and often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer. If you are providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

## Security Safeguards

We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services. You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret. Once you have registered with us, we will never ask you for your password. Please create a unique password for your Unlaunch account and do not use it for any other web services or applications. Do not share your password with anyone else.

Unlaunch takes security very seriously, and if you have reason to believe that your data or someone else’s data is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world but with our data stored in the United States.

## Data retention

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
