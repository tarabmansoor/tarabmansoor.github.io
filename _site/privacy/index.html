<p><em>Last Updated: May 10, 2020</em></p>

<p>Unlauch (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your right to privacy and takes data privacy very seriously. This privacy policy explains who we are, how we collect, share and use Personal Information, and how you can exercise your privacy rights. This privacy policy applies to personal information that we collect through our website (unlaunch.io, www.unlaunch.io), our blog (blog.unlaunch.io) and when you use or interact with our services.</p>

<p>This policy does not apply to the information Unlaunch receives from the third-party websites, mobile apps and other digital products that use the Unlaunch services. When our customers use the Unlaunch on their own websites and products, they remain responsible for their own privacy and security practices, which may differ from ours. You should consult the relevant privacy policies on our customers’ websites and products to find out more about their privacy practices and your related choices</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our use of your personal information, then please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. If you disagree with the practices described in this policy, then you should (a) take necessary steps to remove cookies from your computer after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue your use of our services.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-unlaunch-do">What Does Unlaunch Do?</h2>

<p>Unlaunch is a feature release and experimentation platform built for engineering teams, product teams in small startups to large enterprises. We provide a complete solution to enable teams to release their features into production quickly and safely. We also allow teams to be data-driven and make informed decisions on their feature releases based on actual data.</p>

<h2 id="data-that-we-collect">Data That We Collect</h2>

<p>The Personal Information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Unlaunch, your Unlaunch account settings, the products and features you use, your location, and applicable law. However, the Personal Information we collect broadly falls into the following categories:</p>

<h3 id="account-profile-and-contact-information">Account, Profile and Contact Information.</h3>

<p>Certain parts of our Website may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.</p>

<p>In some cases another user (such as an administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including personal information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products). We collect Information under the direction of our customers and often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer. If you are providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information.

<p>Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them. We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.</p>

<h4 id="analytics-information">Analytics Information</h4>

<p>We collect analytics information when you use our Website and services to help us improve our products. In the services, this analytics information consists of the feature and functions being used, the associated organization and domain name, the username and IP address of the individual who is using the feature or function, and additional information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of the services are being affected. The analytics information we collect may include personal information or business information that the user has chosen to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in the Unlaunch product.</p>

<p>Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. “Usage Data” is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain personal information.</p>

<p>The types of information we collect from third parties include account and/or contact information and we use the information we receive from these third parties to, including but not limited to, market and sell to you, and/or maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you, etc.</p>

<h3 id="information-that-our-users-provide">Information that our users provide</h3>

<h4 id="end-user-data">End-user data</h4>

Our customers have a responsibility to understand the data they send to us and to take the appropriate disclosures, precautions, and responsibilities regarding the content of the service data they provide to us. We utilize this data for no purpose except to deliver the functionality that the Unlaunch platform provides to our customers.</p>

<p>In general, we will use the personal information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information.</p>

<p>To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</p>

<h2 id="eea-resident-rights">EEA Resident Rights</h2>

<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>

<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</p>

<h2 id="security-safeguards">Security Safeguards</h2>

<p>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. However, no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services. You are responsible for keeping your username and password secret. Once you have registered with us, we will never ask you for your password. Please create a unique password for your Unlaunch account and do not use it for any other web services or applications. Do not share your password with anyone else.</p>

<p>Unlaunch takes security very seriously, and if you have reason to believe that your data or someone else’s data is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>In the event of a security breach, we will take take necessary measures to ensure the continued safety of data and contact affected parties and relevant regulators within a reasonable amount of time about the scope and scale of the unauthorized disclosure, as required by applicable laws.</p>

<h2 id="international-data-transfers">International data transfers</h2>

<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.</p>

<p>Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States and our third party service providers and partners operate around the world but with our data stored in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="data-retention">Data retention</h2>

<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
