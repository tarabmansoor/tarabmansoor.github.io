Hey everyone, welcome to **docmusings**. This post is going to be all about why playtime is so impotant for babies and children. As a Medical Doctor with a love for all things pediatrics, I often wonder about the ways we can help litle people thrive. Here, the concept of playtime jumps in. For a child or an infant, for that matter, playing is a full time job. Much like the jobs that we hold. It is essential for them in every way, to be able to develop both mentally and physically. 
So how do children play? Is there a specific kind of scince involved? The answer is both yes and no. When children play, thousands of neurons are firing away, making neural pathways and networks that will serve them for their entire life. But do we need to have a PhD to enable them to play in a way that is the developmentally appropriate and, more importantly, enjoyable for them? Absolutely not!
