A child’s mind is a wonderful place- malleable and ready to expand at the slightest cue. This is exactly how nature intended it to be- one look at some seemingly mundane object sends dozens of neurons firing away, storing all the little information that we as adults overlook. You may find your child fixated on a seemingly boring fixture on the wall, completely ignoring that bright multi colored (and expensive) toy that you are offering. The truth is, babies can not see color till about 3 months of age. 


 post is going to be all about why playtime is so important for babies and children. As a Medical Doctor with a love for all things pediatrics, I often wonder about the ways we can help litle people thrive. Here, the concept of playtime jumps in. For a child or an infant, for that matter, playing is a full time job. Much like the jobs that we hold. It is essential for them in every way, to be able to develop both mentally and physically. So how do children play? Is there a specific kind of scince involved? The answer is both yes and no. When children play, thousands of neurons are firing away, making neural pathways and networks that will serve them for their entire life. But do we need to have a PhD to enable them to play in a way that is the developmentally appropriate and, more importantly, enjoyable for them? Absolutely not! Let’s look at some of the earliest toys in the history of mankind.
